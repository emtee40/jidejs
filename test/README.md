# jide.js Intern tests

These tests can be run using [TheIntern.io](http://theintern.io).

## Running the tests

To run the tests, you currently need to open the `node_modules/intern/client.html` file from your local file system.
Replace the `%pathToJide.js%` with the directory where you've cloned the jide.js directory in and open the path in your
browser.

```
file:///%pathToJide.js%/jidejs/node_modules/intern/client.html?config=test/intern
```

TheIntern outputs the test results in the console of your browser, so make sure to open it.
